# Customer_Segmentation-based-on-footprints-made-in-social-media-Facebook-Instagram-or-Youtube


firstly i have imported the social media interactions data from kaggle.
containing some features like timestamp , personid , content id , engagements that they have made for each content , and some features that i felt unnessescary.

i just want to segement the persons by clustering them based on the similar content engagements.

in the event type column i have observed the engagements were 5 kinds VIEW LIKE BOOKMARK COMMENT CREATED FOLLOW.
initially i thought of assigning value 1 to each engagement but later i realised that :

but the views , likes , comments , follow and bookmark are different kinds of engagements i.e, follow >> viewing or liking
so i have decided to add some weights to the engagements -- view < like < comment < follow < bookmark

i have assigned weights like - {'VIEW' : 1 , 'LIKE' : 2 , 'COMMENT CREATED' : 3, 'FOLLOW' : 4 , 'BOOKMARK' : 5 }.

then i have grouped based on the [personid,conrentid] -- sum of events for each unique pair of personid and contentid.

now i have pivoted the content id as columns and person id as index and eventtype sum at mapping each unique pair of personid and contentid.

we now at 1895 rows Ã— 2987 columns

i have used Kmeans clustering with 1 to 100 clusters without any dimensionality reduction to find the optimal number of clusters.
by elbow method i have observed less than 10 clusters is fine.

for 20 kmeans clusters - then i have used the pca to reduce the dimensions and i have iterated 100 to 1000 pca components and observed that 100 components giving the better results.

for 20 clusters - then i have again used pca to reduce the dimensions and iterated over 10 to 100 pca components and observed that 10 components are giving the better results.

for 20 clusters - then i have again used pca to reduce the dimensions and iterated over 1 to 15 pca components and observed that 2 components are giving the better results. with 3 clusters.

the finally finalised 3 clusters with 2 pca components.
